/*
Write one program, that reads a series of integer numbers from the keyboard and performs the tasks de-
scribed below. Each number can be entered as a separate line of text (with the ENTER key pressed at the
end). The entering of numbers should be stopped when the user enters a non-number, e.g. an empty line
or a text like "stop".

After reading the numbers the program should display three lines of text containing information de-
scribed below. Each of the three points â€¢ should result in one line of text. Printing of the results must
occur after all the numbers have been read from the keyboard.

Note: You can use course materials and web search during the test, but do not use any code- gen-
erating tool (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.). Using such tools results in getting 0 points from the test.

how many of the entered numbers are not divisible by 2 nor by 5?

how many of the entered numbers are larger than 15 and at the same time divisible
by 9?

calculate the average of the two values mentioned above.
